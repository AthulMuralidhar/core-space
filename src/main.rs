// the main idea of the project is to port nasa's astrobee into rust
// this is aimed as a prototype for spacecraft core which will go into the space crafts themselves
// so that they can be deployed in space
// main reference repo here: git@github.com:AthulMuralidhar/core-space.git
//main doc guide is here: https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/astrobee.html#autotoc_md513
